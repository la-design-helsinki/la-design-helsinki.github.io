            <p class="body">I was fortunate to be a member of a team that conducted media projects during a year. We produced videos and published them on a YouTube channel called &quot;DUENDE in HELSINKI&quot;.<br><br>Albeit being a newbie to the digital entertainment area, the team enjoyed several moderate successes. Our videos have attracted around 2k5 views on average and about 76 subscribers.<br><br>Of course, these figures above reflect the collective effort of the team. But when we dive deeper behind the scenes, breaking down the entire picture into small pieces, there will be much more to talk about. That is when individual contributing comes to the spotlight. And I have the privilege to see them all. As a team member, I learned precious lessons from their personalities and working mindsets.<br><br>So right now, allow me to introduce you guys to our fellows from the DUENDE team.</p>

          <p class="body">Sollie managed the team projects and made sure that they would be in progress.<br><br>Whenever we came up with an idea for a new project, Sollie would be the most excited member to realise it. Take a glance at her note, you might find a list of important tasks assigned to all team members to achieve the goal.<br><br>A laptop, a calendar, a notebook, and a pen are what Sollie always brought along. That way she could frequently check the deadlines, make reminders, adjust the team&#x27;s calendar, and stay connected with the other team mates.</p>

          <p class="body">Ken directed video shootings and took care of technical issues related to camera and editing process.<br><br>My illustration of Ken is a bit different from his real appearance. It is rather based on my impression of his down-to-earth personality and working style.<br><br>Ken did not usually talk much. He is the man of actions and almost expresses his thoughts via photographs and videos. If you have a chance to meet Ken, you will likely find him with a camera. And trust me, you will get amazed at how random things transform via his lens.<br><br>When it comes to the idea of a new project, Ken usually considered its attainability, whether it could be done from technical and resource perspectives. If the idea met these criteria, Ken would start working on his tasks right away. Cool!</p>

          <p class="body">Anh&#x27;s role was to write video scripts and appear on our videos as a host. Similar to Sollie, Anh has a doer&#x27;s mindset. When taking a task, she would usually make it done no matter what, daring to face up with challenges that might pop up on her way.<br><br>Anh trained herself to become a writer. Besides the scripts, Anh also contributed to the team as a social media content creator. She took care of editing posts and infographics.<br><br>From the illustration, Anh appears holding a microphone. Her look associates her role in the team and to me, it also suggests how friendly she is as a colleague.Â </p>
